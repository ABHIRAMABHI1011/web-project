				<h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
				<p>Transbelt was established in 1971 as a specialist supplier of
					power transmission products to local industry.In the 1980’s the
					company started to diversify it’s product range to include conveyor
					belting,due to a requirement from customers for a faster 24 hour
					emergency response than was currently available.</p>

				<p>As news spread of our breakdown service, the conveyor and
					transmission belting side of our business grew rapidly,and in 1995
					Transbelt relocated to a larger production area on the Liverpool
					waterfront.</p>
					
				<p>What We Believe Our philosophy had always been simple, to
					provide the best value and service available.It was clear,to create
					a superior,competitively priced product,in-house manufacturing was
					crucial. Ultimately, in 2014, it was this need which facilitated
					the construction of a new site,and enabled our expansion into the
					bespoke manufacture of specialised belting.Today we continue our
					focus on customer service and offering professional solutions to
					clients requirements.</p>
